Overview
===============

The project is based on the conversion of pdf
file to the doc file and vice versa. It has all the
features like drag and drop and also you can
choose files from the cloud.
Implementation and Technologies used.
> The frontend compromises of Html, CSS,
Javascript, and bootstrap.
> For the backend, we have used flask
(python).
> Coming to the backend part, we have used
API for the conversion of pdf file to doc
file to maintain the presentation of the file.
The link of API is here
https://dashboard.groupdocs.cloud/#/ where
you need to generate the API key and value.

> For the conversion of doc to pdf, the same
as above.
> For the cloud, you need to generate a few
things from google picker API client id,
project id, API key, and value, etc . link is
here https://console.developers.google.com/
and the documentation of the google picker
API https://developers.google.com/picker/docs
and same goes with dropbox, link https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/.
> Hosting: We have used elastic beanstalk in
aws where there is a separate option for
environment variables where you can change
envs file of the project directly without
undergoing to change envs file from the
project itself.
